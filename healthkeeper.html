            <h2>Empathize</h2>
            <p>Initially, the team started by talking about our own frustrations with healthcare and jumped into trying to identify potential features. I geared the team away from discussing solutions and towards open-ended discovery and research. ‍
                <br><br>
                It was important that we try to address the spectrum of potential users, so we  identified two potential users and created proto- personas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single, Millennial</li>
                <li>Head of Household</li>
            </ul> 
            <img src="images/Proto-Persona.png" style="width: 500px; object-fit: contain;">
            <p>Once we identified who we wanted to speak with, the team conducted user interviews. We also posted a survey to gather quantitative data around people’s experiences managing their health information and received 33 responses.</p>
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>10 Interviews</li>
                <li>10 Questions</li>
                <li>5 Individuals</li>
                <li>5 Parents or Caregivers</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>Key Interview Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How do you keep track of concerns you'd like to discuss with your doctor?</li>
                <li>How do you keep track of medical-related information (i.e. medical history, appointments, insurance, etc.)?</li>
                <li>Do you manage medical information for anyone else?</li>
            </ul> 

            <h3>Findings</h3>

            <div>
            <p> We learned that both the individuals and caregivers struggle to stay organized when it comes to their healthcare. Doctors, prescriptions and insurance tend to change, and it is often hard to keep track of this information. When visiting the doctor, people rely on their memory to communicate their symptoms. For those responsible for the health information of others, it is is even more of a struggle to keep information organized. 
                <br><br>
                Using the data from our interviews and survey results, we created affinity diagrams to continue to better understand our two users and create persona insights and user personas.</p>
            <h3>Jonathan - Persona Insight</h3>
            <p>A young single individual with an active lifestyle needs a reliable way to track their personal health and medical history. </p>
            <h3>Kathy - Persona Insight</h3>
            <p>‍A working parent needs a simple way to track and manage their family’s health because family members don't get thorough care if information is not organized and centralized. </p>

            <p>Understanding our two users helped us develop a problem statement.</p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3> 
            <p>How might we create a centralized system for individuals and families to track and manage their health information and needs?
                <br><br>
                Adults need a better way to store their health history, track ongoing symptoms and document their concerns in order to better understand and address their health needs and the health needs of others.
                <br><br>
                We believe that creating a way to track, organize, and securely store health information in one application will empower adults to take better care of themselves and their families.</p>

        <div class="case-content">
            <h2>Ideate</h2>
            <p>Knowing that Jonathan and Kathy needed a way to track, organize, and securely store health information, we wanted to see if any other apps were addressing these needs. We found apps that let users track and log their health, but we weren’t able to find apps that also let users set up multiple profiles or store their medical and health history and information.</p>
            <img src="images/Competitor Analysis.png" style="width: 60%; object-fit: contain;">
            <p>We identified three key features we believed would benefit Jonathan and Kathy. These features provide both Jonathan and Kathy with the flexibility to use the app in the way that most fits their needs at any given time - whether it’s in their daily lives, when they fill out medical forms at the doctor's office, or are managing the health of others.
                <br><br>
                With the “I Like, I Wish, What If” method and a feature prioritization matrix, we determined the key features that we would be able to deliver to help Kathy and Jonathan achieve their goals of track, organize, and securely store health information in a central location..</p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>Since Jonathan and Kathy are new users, we prototyped the sign-up process when first downloading the app.  The first iteration and prototypes allow users to track their medicine, sleep, exercise, prescriptions, food & water. Users can also store their current health information (ex. Doctor, insurance, prescriptions) as well as their family’s health history.</p>

    <div class="row case-content">
        <div class="case-content">
            <h2>Test</h2>
            <p>The team split into two and created two different wireframes to conduct A/B testing of the navigation.</p>
            <img src="images/Lo-Fi Prototypes.png">
            <p>We were interested to see which features in each version would best facilitate the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can easily sign up/log in and navigate to the dashboard. </li>
                <li>Users can locate where they would be input their or their family members’ personal health history.</li>
                <li>Users know where to track their daily moods.</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Task 1 - Sign up and navigate to the dashboard</li>
                <li>Task 2 - Locate where to input medical history</li>
                <li>Task 3 - Locate where to log daily mood. Select your mood for today</li>
            </ol> 
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-05-19 at 11.45.27 AM.png" style="width: 500px; object-fit: contain;">
            <p>
            Through testing, we learned that users liked the “My Health Dashboard” feature in Prototype A. This feature allows users to use the app in the ways that best suits them instead of forcing them to use the log feature when they first sign up or login.‍
            <br><br>
            That being said, users expressed confusion around the wording in the coaching screens and the text on the dashboard. ‍
            <br><br>
            Most importantly, users wanted the ability to customize their dashboards and the information they logged and tracked. Users can track their prescriptions, mood, sleep, exercise, symptoms,  food and water. The iteration we tested did not give users the option to determine or arrange what they track.

            <div class="case-content">
                <h2>Implement</h2>
                <p>With these pain points in mind, we iterated the prototype to have the following features so Jonathan and Kathy could continue to have flexibility over their experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health Dashboard</li>
                    <li>Dashboard Customization</li>
                    <li>Circular Profile Photo</li>
                    <li>Calendar Feature</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Applying the 60-30-10 rule, we created a light and inviting color palette. Individually, I created custom icons for each button throughout the app.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Given the short time frame, we were unable to build out and test all of the features that would benefit  Jonathan and Kathy. With more time, we would do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Additional user testing, including multiple profiles feature</li>
                    <li>Add “Premium” features</li>
                    <li>Develop  charts to allow users to compare data and discover correlations between their habits and their health</li>
                    <li>Expand reminders for individual logging categories, appointments, etc.</li>
                    <li>Specific tracking for chronic conditions</li>
                    <li>Sharing Feature</li>
                    <li>Incorporate accessibility </li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Even with the time  constraints, we developed our UX/UI and collaboration skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Group dynamics such as accountability and communication outside of class</li>
                    <li>Prioritization of tasks and app features to keep up with agile project pace</li>
                    <li>Learning to let go of ideas and ego for sake of our users</li>
                    <li>Determining requirements for a Minimum Viable Product</li>
